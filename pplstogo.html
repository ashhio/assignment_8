        Plano Public Library To Go

    <p>
      Redesigning an app for the Plano Public Library System
    </p>

    <h2>
        Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
        My hometown's public library system has an outdated mobile app riddled with functionality and design issues, 
        leaving users unsatisfied. In an attempt to help residents take full advantage of the public library, 
        I redesigned the app to make it easier for users to access the library catalog and learn more about what 
        services the library has to offer.
    </p>
    <h2>
        The Problem
    </h2>
    <p>
        The City of Plano offers a free app that allows residents to search the Plano Public Library catalog, 
        place items on hold, renew items, access their account, and view upcoming library events. On the Google Play store, 
        the app has several negative reviews: 
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>"The interface takes me back 5 years. "Outdated" is an understatement."</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>"Not at all user friendly. Any action would need a sign in again and again. The remember me option never worked."</i> 
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>"The ui needs to be improved"</i> 
        <br>
        <br>
        With over 5,000 downloads on the Google Play store, this app is an important way for residents to access the library catalog.
        If the app's UI is updated and user experience is improved, residents will be more satisfied with the app and can take full advantage 
        of what the public library has to offer.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Identifying User and Business Needs
    </h2>
    <p>
        <b>User Needs (taken from reviews)</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Updated user interface</li>
            <li>Improved error messages & error prevention</li>
            <li>Browse for books based on genre, subject, etc (like a library) rather than just searching</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Business Needs (assumed, based on original app’s design)</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Needs to showcase library events and services and online resources</li>
            <li>Needs to show library announcements & closures</li>
            <li>Needs to store library cards</li>
            <li>Needs to function like the library catalog (search for books, put books on hold, check holds, account balance, renew books, etc)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>
      Heuristic Evaluation  
    </h2>
    <p>
        I evaluated the Plano Library app using Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics. 
        Some of the problems I found in the app include confusing language and labels and limited navigation freedom. 
        I also noticed that the font size was small, the text was cramped, and there was a lack of visual hierarchy in the app.
    </p>

                <th scope = "col">Usability Heuristics</th>

                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th scope = "row">Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</td>
                <td>Too much information on each screen

                <th scope = "row">Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</td>
                <td> 
                    Lack of error messages when app does not function as expected
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <h2>
        Prototype 
    </h2>
    <p>
        I created a prototype using the wireframe from the previous step. 
        I used the desktop version of the Plano Library catalog and the current app to inform my visual design decisions. T
        he library seems to be going for a friendly, minimalistic look, and they use rainbow colors.
        To improve readability, I used larger fonts, typefaces that had ample contrast, and language that users could easily understand. 
        I also made sure that buttons and links were appropriately sized and spaced, and updated the design to look more modern.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Testing
    </h2>
    <p>
        To test my hypothesis, I conducted a usability test to compare my prototype and the original Plano Library app. 
        I hoped to see a greater task completion rate with my prototype, indicating that my design was more effective. 
        I also hoped the participant would think that my prototype looked more modern than the original app. 
        After the usability test, I modified the prototype as a result of the participant's recommendations. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Findings & recommendations:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Make the books smaller on the search homepage to not overshadow the headings</li>
            <li>Tapping on “search” on bottom nav should pop screen back up to top & open search box</li>
            <li>Location of events was unclear: Resources page should have a link to library events, which takes you to “visit” & events portion</li>
            <li>Further testing on barcode</li>
            <li>Find out ways to make the prototype more visually appealling</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>
        Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
        I redesigned the mobile app for my hometown's public library and evaluated the effectiveness of my redesign with a comparative usability test. 
        The test results indicate that my redesign may be more user-friendly and achieves the business and user goals effectively, 
        but more tests need to be conducted to prove this claim. Regardless, I learned a lot from this project about user testing, 
        information architecture, and implementing usability guidelines. 
        I realize I have a lot to learn about conducting and constructing usability tests that can gather the most pertinent information. 
        If I were to do this project again, I would have conducted usability tests with the original app before coming up with a hypothesis or strategy. 
        In the future, I would like to learn how to construct usability tests that I can run throughout the design process, recruit many participants, 
        and process more data to improve my designs.
